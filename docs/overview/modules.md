# Modules

`spider-web` is made with bundle sizes, code splitting, and tree-shaking in mind. The core module of `spider-web` is comparable in size to vanilla `redux` and exports the [createStore()](../api/createStore.md) function. Currently, there are 2 more modules in `spider-web`: `spider-web/operators` and `spider-web/react`. `spider-web/operators` is discussed in the docs for [operators](./operators.md).
